# temporal-contract branding

The illustrated mascot preserves the btravstack pink beet and its original
project motif: a pink beet inside an hourglass. The canonical
source is [the website brand generator](https://github.com/btravstack/btravstack.github.io/blob/main/scripts/generate-brand.mjs).

To refresh them, run the generator in that repository and copy the generated
`apps/website/public/logos/temporal-contract-{light,dark,mono,favicon}.svg`
files into `docs/public/` as `logo-light.svg`, `logo-dark.svg`, `logo-mono.svg`
and `favicon.svg`. Keep `logo.svg` identical to `logo-light.svg` as the fallback.
The matching social card is `docs/public/og-temporal-contract.png` (1200 × 630),
rendered from the [editable social-card template](https://github.com/btravstack/btravstack.github.io/blob/main/branding/social-card.html)
with `?project=temporal-contract`.

The README, documentation navigation and hero select a mark for the reader's
color scheme. The monochrome variant preserves the illustration in grayscale
and supplies the decorative CSS mask. A dedicated variant serves as the favicon.
All assets are
committed locally so documentation builds and deployed pages remain independent
of the website repository. The docs configuration applies the current deployment
base to favicon and social-card URLs, including prerelease deployments.
